# SSOM RFCs

The **Standardized Semantic Object Model (SSOM)** defines an open, vendor-neutral, AI-native semantic standard for Operational Technology (OT) data.

SSOM focuses on **meaning**, not transport. It standardizes how industrial assets, telemetry, and relationships are represented so that analytics, AI models, and autonomous systems can work across vendors, plants, and industries.

## Why SSOM Exists

Industrial AI initiatives consistently fail not due to lack of data or models, but because operational data lacks:
- Shared semantic meaning
- Global asset identity
- Explicit relationships
- AI-ready structure

SSOM addresses this gap.

## What This Repository Contains

- Public RFCs defining SSOM
- XML schemas for core semantic objects
- Conformance requirements
- A BigQuery reference implementation
- Example analytics queries

## Status

- **RFC-0001:** Draft / Experimental
- Open for public comment and contribution

## Non-Goals

SSOM does NOT:
- Replace OT protocols (OPC-UA, MQTT, Modbus)
- Define control logic
- Compete with OEM systems

SSOM operates **above** OT systems as a semantic abstraction layer.
